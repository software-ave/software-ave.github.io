<p>而这里，是软件大道的尽头。换句话说，这里是，宇宙中心的尽头 :）</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/20240302/P1030804.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>没错，软件大道的尽头是小行。这座碑刻着“小行”这个名字的来历。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>雨花区老地名</p>
  <h2 id="小行">小行</h2>
  <p>清代地名。今雨花路旧名米行大街，而此处米市规模相对较小，故名“小米行”。简称小行，曾名小行里，亦称小行街，小行镇。<br />
雨花台区文化局立<br />
二零一五年五月</p>

站在终点往东望去，高架桥下面，视野并不是很好。</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/20240302/P1030811.jpeg" alt="" />
把软件大道阻断的，正是这条铁路–宁芜铁路。<br />
火车来的时候，这里会拦起来，上下班高峰时，两边挤满电动车的场面也很壮观。<br />
穿过这个铁道就是河西了。软件大道西边连着的就是河西大街。</p>

赛虹桥街道办事处和南京公安局地铁分局，闹中取静，坐落在这条岔路的深处。
岔路的尽头是一个小区叫翡翠谷，很幽静，旁边的小山上据说还有野猪出没…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/20240302/P1030814.jpeg" alt="" />
这算是软件大道西的第一座建筑。现在是个酒店了。以前是电信职工培训中心的宾馆。因为办公楼拆了，中博信息技术研究院（曾经叫江苏电信技术研究院）可能暂时在这栋楼里办公。</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/20240302/P1030815.jpeg" alt="" />

这就是中博信息技术研究院之前的办公场地，现在是工地了。</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/20240302/P1030819.jpeg" alt="" />
这棵树运气不错，周围的建筑全都荡然无存，它却存活下来了。</p>

软件大道和西春路的交界处。这个广场终于完工了，现在的名字叫“江苏南海科技广场”，之前的名字是“花神科技广场”，二十年前这里叫“花神家具港”</p>

马上到安德门大街。
<img src="/assets/images/20240302/P1030858.jpeg" alt="" />
这座可能是软件大道上最著名的烂尾建筑–“东方娃娃”，很有童话色彩的建筑，不知道为什么它就烂尾了，我来软件大道工作的时候它就在这杵着了，估摸着得有20多年了。</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/20240302/P1030859.jpeg" alt="" />

和东方娃娃一街之隔的就是荣耀大厦。很有科技感的建筑。这种对比挺有意思 :）</p>

<p>走到安德门大街的时候，我的相机也没电了，这次就到这里，下次从安德门大街接着往东走。</p>]]></content><author><name>cutlass</name></author><category term="gossip" /><category term="city walk" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[对于南京的码农来说，软件大道就是宇宙的中心。]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/images/20240302/P1030863.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/images/20240302/P1030863.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="/welcome-to-jekyll/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2019-02-04T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-02-04T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="/welcome-to-jekyll/"><![CDATA[<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory.

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>

<p>As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.</p>

<h2 id="special-formatting">Special formatting</h2>

<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>strike through</del></li>
  <li>==highlight==</li>
  <li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-code-blocks">Writing code blocks</h2>

<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/8.jpg" alt="walking" /></p>

<h2 id="reference-lists">Reference lists</h2>

<p>The quick brown jumped over the lazy.</p>

<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>

<h2 id="full-html">Full HTML</h2>

<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.</p>

<p>An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this!

<p>The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.</p>

<p>As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundler</code> is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> files inform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bundler</code> about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec</code> and just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run jekyll serve</code>.</p>

<p>When you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bundler</code> uses the gems and versions as specified in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile.lock</code> to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.</p>

<p>For more information about how to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bundler</code> in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly.</p>]]></content><author><name>sal</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[gem install bundler installs the bundler gem through RubyGems.

<p>It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture.

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.</p>

<p>As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.</p>

<p>An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.</p>
